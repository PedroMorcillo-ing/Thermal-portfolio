# Thermal Engineering Portfolio

Mechanical Design Engineer (5 years experience in industrial systems and rail engineering) expanding into mission-critical thermal systems and energy infrastructure.

This repository documents applied engineering work in:

- Vapor compression refrigeration systems
- Chilled water and hydronic design
- Heat exchanger selection and performance
- Energy efficiency metrics (COP, EER, PUE)
- Regulatory awareness (EN 378, EU F-Gas)

The focus is on engineering reasoning, structured calculations, and system-level decision making.

Each project follows a professional format:
- Design basis
- Assumptions
- Calculations
- Technical trade-offs
- Risk assessment

Ongoing technical development.
